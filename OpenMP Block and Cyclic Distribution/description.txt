Intro to HPC Homework #4

== WARNING ==
- Uncommenting lines 21 and 40 will reveal print messages for #1 and #2 that display their output

Running (bash / Linux) :
- Compile Command  :  gcc HW4.c -o HW4.out -fopenmp
- Run Command      :  ./HW4.out

P.S. Sometimes when you run it very quickly and repeatedly, the even counter will be lower by 8 * N,
    seems to be from N number of threads not being free from previous run.
