Intro to HPC Homework #6
**Tested natively on laptop's GTX 1650 Super

== WARNING ==
- No special instructions, program executes in single run with no need
    for commenting/uncommenting lines.
- Code / function calls for both exercises are marked in code.
- Commented out Exercises 1 & 2 are what I originally wrote
    - I originally thought Dr. Bein just wanted literally 2 __host__ functions
    - Both work but disregard them (only saved for myself)

Running (bash / Linux) :
- Compile  : nvcc HW6.cu -o HW6.out
- Run      : ./HW6.out
