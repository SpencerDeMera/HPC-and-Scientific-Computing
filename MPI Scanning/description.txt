Intro to HPC Homework #3

== FIXED Version ==
- Figured it out today after class + with first submission comments
- Removed uncessary Send & Recv statements & if-checks
- Left hardcoded array and MPI_Scan operator for it but commented out

Running (bash / Linux) :
- Compile Command  : mpicc HW3.c -o HW3.out
- Run Command      : mpirun --oversubscribe -np 8 ./HW3.out
